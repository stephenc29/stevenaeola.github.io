# Creating

In a group of about five computers (still working in pairs), create a sound track to a short film. Try to think about the structure of your sound track, and what you want to do about each of these dimensions of music:

* pitch
* duration
* dynamics
* tempo
* timbre
* texture
* structure

if you want any of these to change during your piece (particularly dynamics and tempo) then you can just redeploy with different values, but ask about better ways of doing this.
